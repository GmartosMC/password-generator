## A Password Generator made with Python

### Install

Download the Project:

```
git clone https://github.com/GmartosMC/password-generator
```

I recommend to create a virtual environment to avoid dependency issues. In the root of the project in the terminal:

```
python -m venv /ruta/al/entorno/virtual
```

To activate it, on Windows in the project root use:

```
venv\Scripts\activate
```

On Linux and Mac:

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

This project uses Flet for the GUI. You can just install the dependencies with the following command within the project:

```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or manually:

```
pip install flet
```
